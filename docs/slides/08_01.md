The form tag itself has no special container class since form elements can be used in other elements without a form tag., but for other elements you should use Bootstrap classes to take advantage of the styling.

`form-label` goes on the labels

`form-control` goes on input fields and other form elements

`form-text` - goes on text that you want to be part of the form as information. You can use the `aria-describedby` class that is tied to this help.

Other than these fields, make sure you add the proper inputs and create the forms as you normally would in HTML.
