If you're loading items, there's another class you can use besides progress bars. The spinners are similar, but with fewer options and some odd choices.

Spinners like progress bars have a container class of `spinner-border`. However, to color these spinners you use the {text-COL} classes instead of the border classes. It's just the way the different classes are designed, but then that's probably an unfortunate name for the spinner.

You can add a `role="status"` class as well for assistive devices and inside the spinner, you should include some text with a visually-hidden class. That way, assistive devices will be able to read the text, but a regular browser won't display it.
