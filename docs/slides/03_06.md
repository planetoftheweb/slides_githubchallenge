# Images and Figures

A few classes help you control how images and figures work.

# Images

`img-fluid` `img-thumbnail`

There are two specific classes related to images, the `img-fluid` class will automatically let you build responsive images. It sets the width of the image to 100% and the height to auto so it scales with the parent.

## There's a separate class called `img-thumbnail` that creates a thumbnail image with a slight outline. I don't really use this one very often, but it looks nice.

# Floats

`float-start` `float-end`

`clearfix`

To align element to content you can use two classes. Bootsrap 5 has RTL, or right to left support to whereas you may think of the float-start as a float-left and float-end and float-right.

Containers with floated elements can lose track of the height of floated items, so Bootstrap provides a clearfix class that takes care of this.

`figure` `figure-img` `figure-caption`

Figures is an HTML element that lets you specify an image an it's text. Bootsrrap provides a few classes that helps set up a certain style for these elements.
