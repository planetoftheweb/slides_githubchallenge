You can add a `form-select` class to a select field with two size options.

Switches are coded exactly the same as checkboxes, except that they have the `form-switch` class added to the `form-check` container.

By default `form-check` groups will stack on top of one another, by adding the `form-check-inline` class, the layout of the `form-check` elements appear side by side.

The btn-check options lets you use buttons instead of checkboxes. I think it's hard to tell the difference between a checked and unchecked button unless you use outlines.
