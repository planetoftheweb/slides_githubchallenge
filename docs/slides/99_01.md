The bootstrap site are extremely well put together and have a lot of examples on how to use the framework. There's actually a tab you should click [called examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/) to take a peek at sample components.

One of the cool pages is called [the Cheatsheet](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/cheatsheet/), which is a list of samples of all of the components in a convenient place with links to the documentation.

There's also a site that supports bootstrap development where you can [purchase Themes](https://themes.getbootstrap.com/) that are based on bootsrap.

Finally, if you want to know what I'm up to, check out raybo.org my blog...which, by the way, was built with Bootstrap 5, where you can find links to my social media, additional videos and links to all my social media.

Make sure you connect with me on LinkedIn https://linkedin.com/in/planetoftheweb. I post new tips, tricks and tutorials on weekdays.

Thanks for watching and good luck in your learning journey.
