When working with project, it's really important to be able to store certain ids, variables and special passwords securely. For this Challenge, I want you to store a secret using Github, and retrieve it using Github Actions.

I'll give you a couple of seconds to pause the video and see how you'd have solved it.

To store a secret in Github, you'll need to

1. Go to your account
1. Find a repository that you want to add a secret to
1. Click on settings
1. Choose secrets

Now, you can create a secret that will be stored by Github and accessible, but not viewable by anyone with access to this account.

1. Click on New Repository Secret
2. Give the Secret a Name
3. Paste in the value of your secret.

Before you click on the Add Secret button, make sure that this secret is stored somewhere else securely. You can use a password manager to store a secure note.

You won't be able to retrieve this secret once you hit that green button.

1. Hit the Add Secret button

Your options after you add a secret are only to remove it or update it.

You can use this secret with Github Actions as part of your build process.

```
name: Favorite Google Fonts

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      google_api_key: ${{secrets.GOOGLE_API_KEY}}

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Get the Font List
        run: |
          git config --global user.name "${GITHUB_ACTOR}"
          git config --global user.email "${INPUT_EMAIL}"
          curl -s --url https://www.googleapis.com/webfonts/v1/webfonts?key=${{secrets.GOOGLE_API_KEY}} >> fontsList.json
          git add -A && git commit -m "Updated Fonts List"
          git push --set-upstream origin main
```
