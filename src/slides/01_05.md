# Fixing a committed password

Ocassionaly, you may end up pushing a commit or a file that has some sensitive information, like a password or API key. You don't want to destroy your entire history, but make a more surgical change. Assumig you've submitted a file with a password and then some other commits, how do you make sure Github doesn't store passwords in it's history.

I'll give you a couple of seconds to pause the video and see how you'd have solved it.

Alright. There's a few ways to do this and in the last video, I showed you how to delete the entire history of a project. For this one. In a previous video, I showed you how to do a rebase, but we need more surgical and I'm going to use regular Git to take care of it.

Here's a project where I've done a series of commits and you can see here that I have one here called "uploaded credentials". That's what I want to get rid of, but I've done a few commits after that.

You can see commits on Github by adding the `/commits` to the URL of the project.

I have this same project in my local hard drive and to take care of it, I'm going to do an interactive rebase, but first, let's see the list of commits on our local machine.

I can do that by issuing a `git log --oneline`. I like the online option because it makes the log a lot shorter.

We uploaded the credentials on this commit. We want to delete that commit from history, but also make sure that the other changes to the repo are accepted.

First, we need to do a commit that deletes this authentication file.

git add -A && git commit -m "Deleted Authentication"

Now, lets do an interactive rebase.

```
git rebase -i HEAD~4
```

This means that we want to rebase the repo with the interactive option and we want to work with the last four files.

This will fire up our editor. That might be set up to VIM on your machine. I have mine set to Atom.

You can see a lot of options written out in the comments. What I'm going to do here is re-order the commits so that there is a first commit, and then I'll do my adding and deleting in a row instead of in the order I did it in.

I'm going to switch the two commits to the fix option. That option is going to squash these commits, but get rid of the log message.

Once I'm done I'll take a look at the log again and you can see that the two offending commits are gone as if they never happened. Let me push this into github.

```
git push -f
```

# Conclusion

Interactive commits are super useful, but do create permanent changes so be extremely careful. There are a lot of options available that let you re-write the history of your project.
