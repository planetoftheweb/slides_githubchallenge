# Deleting your Commit History

Git is such a fantastic tool, and it' a great idea to commit and push often, since it's a great way to store changes to a project in the cloud, but ocassionally, I'd like to publish a project on Github with a clean commit history. How would you delete ALL commit history on Github.

I'll give you a couple of seconds to pause the video and see how you'd have solved it.

Here's what I would do. You can create what's called an orphan branch. This is a branch that has all of the files as the current branch without any history.

```
git checkout --orphan clean_branch
```

Now you'll need to add and commit the files into a history.

```
git add -A
git commit -am "Squeaky Clean History"
```

This branch is going to replace your project's main branch, so let's go ahead and delete that.

```
git branch -D main
```

Now we can take our current orphan branch and rename it to the name of our main branch.

```
git branch -m main
```

Now it's time to push

```
git push -f origin main
```

# Conclusion

Now the commit history at Github will be nice and clean. What happens in local, sometimes doesn't need to go to Github. Orphan branches are a pretty useful way to keep things clean.

This is also a great way to reset things when playing with git and Github, but I do suggest you use a private repo for your experiments.

```
git checkout --orphan clean_branch
git commit -am "Squeaky Clean History"
git branch -D main
git branch -m main
git push -f origin main
```
