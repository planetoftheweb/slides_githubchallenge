# Automating Tasks

Using bash was a lot of fun, so let's do another one. This time, I want you to try to go through every branch of a repo...no matter how many branches there are and then copy a certain folder in each branch of the repo, to another folder on your desktop. Each branch should go in it's own folder.

I'll give you a couple of minutes to figure out how you'd do something like this.

# Solution

This one's a bit tougher, but it's a lot less code because you have to figure out a way to get the list of files.

```bash
# !/bin/bash
```

We start up like in any bash scrip with the location of the the bash compiler.

```bash
for BRANCH in `git branch --list|sed 's/*//g'`;
```

Now we're going to loop through every branch in the current repo. How do we do that?

What we need in a loop like for is an array, and remember that in the last video we saw that the arrayws are separated by whitespace. Also, remember that all bash is doing is issue the commands you would if you went to the terminal and typed them in.

So lets try the git branch command with the list option.

```bash
git branch --list
```

We get a list of all the branches that's almost perfect except for the. Now, in the terminal a pipe character | allows you to filter one command by another. By using it here we're providing a regular expression with the filter, which removes the extra asterisk in the list's current output.

```bash
git branch --list|sed 's/*//g'
```

Now that it makes sense we can do the do and done commands and do whatever we want to do to each branch. So we start by checking out each branch.

```bash
git checkout $BRANCH
```

Now we can create a directory for our branches. We'll use the -p option so that the computer creates it if it doesn't currently exist.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Desktop/backup/$BRANCH
```

and finally copy the files there. We're using the cp command and the recursive option and it will copy everything to our folder with the name of our branch.

```bash
cp -R builds/* ~/Desktop/backups/$BRANCH/
```

I've got this all set up just like the previous code challenge so you can see it in action.

There are three branches and the bash script is stored in my home directory. We're inside our project folder and will execute the command.

```bash
sh ~/git-backup.sh
```

# Conclusion

I've got several bash scripts that automate different parts of my Github process. They're a great way to take care of repetitive task and can do anything.

```bash
# !/bin/bash

for BRANCH in `git branch --list|sed 's/\*//g'`;
	do
	  git checkout $BRANCH
	  mkdir -p ~/Desktop/backup/$BRANCH
	  cp -R build/* ~/Desktop/backup/$BRANCH/
	done
```
