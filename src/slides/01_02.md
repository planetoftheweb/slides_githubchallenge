# Merging a Linear History

> >

Let's say that you are working on a new feature for your project, but in the meantime someone is working on a different feature. What's a good way to add your commits after their commits without creating a messy timeline.

I'll give you a couple of seconds to pause the video and see how you'd have solved it.

One of the first commands you learn when working with Github is how to merge your changes onto a master branch.

Merging is the more common of the merge commands, but there's another merging strategy that will work better to create a more linear history that take into account other changes that users might have performed.

Here I have a project and I've started a feature branch called newfeature. Let's go ahead and push this to Github.

git add -A
git commit -m "Finished editing the header for the site"
git push

Let's switch over to Github and take a look at what's happening there.

I can see that my new commits generated the option to create a pull request.

We can take a look at the changes, which are pretty simple.

However if we were to look at the history, someone already made changes to the project.

When you merge a project you have three options for making the changes. The most common is the merge.

However the third option...a rebase will give us a cleaner history. Here's how it's different.

---

# Rebase

- Replays commits at the end of a branch
- Creates a cleaner, more linear project history

Some teams actually require rebasing instead of the traditional merge methodology.

A couple of important notes

---

# Important

- A Rebase is destructive unlike merge
  Alghought it creates a cleaner history, rebase is adding new commits to the end of a branch and these are similar, but technically different than commits you've done in the past.
- Don't rebase a public branch
  Because of this, it's important that you don't rebase a public branch, because to create the cleaner history, it's ignoring your original branch and making new copies of your commits on the branch your rebasing to.
