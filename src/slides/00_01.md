# Github

> >

With more than 65 million developers and 200 million repositories, Github is the place that developers use to build, ship and maintain code.

Hey there, this is Ray Villalobos and in this course, I'm going to challenge you to use Github to solve different problems on your projects.

We'll start out with some basic Git Commands, do a bit of time traveling by changing histories, then move on to automation using the terminal and bash scripts. We'll end up with different ways to use Github Actions to run accessibility audits, use secrets, build and deploy your sites.

Most solutions are less than a dozen lines of code. Most videos can be watched on their own and don't require you to have completed the previous challenges.

So good luck and let's get hubbing.
